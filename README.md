# TripActionsInterview

Tests have been written using Maven Library and TestNG. 

To run the tests clone the repository in local system. 
Install Maven if not installed. 
Navigate to pom.xml file in terminal/CMD
Run "mvn test" to run the tests.


# Please Note: 
Currently tests have been written to verify Selenium skills. Please ignore code formatting, hardcoded locators, identation, unused imports. I can convert the tests to POM if required.
